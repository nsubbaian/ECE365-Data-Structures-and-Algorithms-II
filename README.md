## Program #1:
Brief Overview of Assignment (more details in folder): First, you are going to create a hash table class. Then you are going to write a program that uses your hash table class to read in a "dictionary" and spell check a "document". For the purposes of this assignment, a valid word is defined as any sequence of valid characters, and the valid characters are letters (capital and lowercase), digits (0 - 9), dashes (-), and apostrophes ('). Every other character is considered a word separator.

## Program #2:
Brief Overview of Assignment (more details in folder): You are going to create a class called "heap" that provides programmers with the functionality of a priority queue using a binary heap implementation. Each item inserted into the binary heap will specify a unique string id, an integer key, and optionally any pointer. The implementation of the class should use pointers to void in order to handle pointers to any type of data. When a heap is declared, a capacity will be passed to its constructor representing the maximum number of items that may be in the heap at one time; the heap will never be allowed to grow past its initial capacity (although it is not difficult to implement a resize operation).

## Program #3:
Brief Overview of Assignment (more details in folder): You are going implement Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the single-source shortest-path problem. The program will determine the shortest path in a specified graph from a specified starting vertex to each other vertex in the graph. In order to do this efficiently, your program should use the binary heap class that you created for the previous assignment.

## Program #4:
Brief Overview of Assignment (more details in folder): This problem came from the 1998 regional ACM Programming Contest. As I described in class, it was the only question my Columbia team did not complete in the time limit. We had a solution which would work given unlimited time, but we did not realize it was an exponential time solution for contrived input. I am letting you know that the solution (probably) requires dynamic programming to be implemented efficiently.
